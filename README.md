# simple_server_management
A simple project that implements the exchange with the server through the user interface.

I received this task as a test assignment.
It seemed interesting to me, so i decided to keep it here.

That project able to:

1. Receive data in the form {manufacturer, name, price, amount} from the web interface via HTML-request(POST)
and save it to a file in form 'manufacturer' :: 'name' :: 'price' :: 'amount'(with validity check);
2. Display saved data in a table;
3. Remove data from file by clicking on the row;
4. Show a summary hint when hovering over row;
5. Sort the data in the table in natural order when clicking on the column name.
